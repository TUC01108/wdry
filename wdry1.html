    A new day. New focus. New to do list. Some of the same tasks. Let's prioritize and complete everything.
    Switched from signed in as work github to personal. Hopefully ok.
    Think I knew this before but had to change the user.name and user.email in the terminal through git config --global user.email
    git config --global user.name so that commits come from personal account.
    Goals for today- update confluence 100% for validation for PDR and Key Replacement. Commit to feature branch for each 100%.
    Begin with WR validation. Better define what "Begin" means in a goal setting perspective.
    Other than goals I want to learn Java deeply. But not just Java more important for me is concepts that cross language boundaries.
    I want to begin O1v app or 01v or 0v1... hmmmm. Any ways get it off the ground. Concept. proof of concept what does that look like.
    Landing page. social area. social playground. connects into important stuff. security is everything. needs to be safe. identity.
    proof of identity for every login without it being a hassle. how to prove you are the correct person. because if this isnt 100%.
    then idea is bad. wallets plug in safely and securely. it is a hot wallet. and cold wallet layers. interact with others.
    monetize in one place. be your own everything. this is your pop up shop. this is your bank. this is your front facing image.
    this is where you show who you are and what you have to offer. and where money goes and is safe. and where it grows. and where
    you define risk and lend in various products. marketplace for others to build and share. decentralized opportunity.

    More important is to work through priorities so will copy and paste frequently until they
    are all done.-
    Commit to feature branch for PDR 100%.
    Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation. 
    Begin WR validation. Better define what "Begin" means in a goal setting perspective.

    Instead of begin let's define better now. how about analyze WR validation and make a list of 
    validations that exist NOW and validations that need to be added.
    That's better.

    Commit to feature branch for PDR 100%.
    Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation. 
    make a list of WR validations that exist NOW.
    make a list of WR validations that need to be added.

    Also I committed to feature branch for PDR already so going to remove that one and see if 
    after review we need to re-add it.

    Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation. 
    make a list of WR validations that exist NOW.
    make a list of WR validations that need to be added.

</p>
<p>
    Confirmed PDR feature branch looks good and ready for review. on to next task. Key Replacement.
    NEED:
    -Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    -update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    -update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation.

    NICE TO HAVE:
    -make a list of WR validations that exist NOW.
    -make a list of WR validations that need to be added.

    List is looking good. 3 things. 3 hours and one minute is enough time.

    Got in the office early. Runnning stand up in a few and then will begin the day and update here.

    Tried to diagnose what was going on with a service error that QA was getting when trying to save draft from
    UI and then from sending request in service for cp port. Burned a lot of time trying to figure this out.
    I think going forward I need to document the process for trying to identify what is happening.
    In the sameway that CW1 looks at a problem and goes from one starting point and then branches towards
    a solution rather than pepper spraying and seeing all the possible problems or trying to see it from
    my perspective. Like a system for idenifying where the best starting point is. Starting from that starting point
    and going layer by layer which uncovers what is actually happening. If I was to write a rough draft of what this
    looks like it would be. Okay problem with saving a draft. Error is 500. Find in logs where error is popping up.
    It appears at read only fields where a null pointer is happening for partyId. Why is partyId null for this request?
    For non ancillary product we should not be checking for partyId? and this is where we are now.
