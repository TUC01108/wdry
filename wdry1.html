    I took the advice offered yesterday to meditate for 10 and write in journal for 10 and read for 10 and it worked.
    Feel great this morning. Got to desk at 6:53am. Let's identify if we can find some efficiency to make 6:45am arrival
    time but for now I am happy. I'll be able to leave from desk at 14:45 so we dont have to rush to Olava class if we are
    still doing that today.
    -------------------------------
    okay time for WR.

<p> 
    Well my changes to our config repo are in but they arent showing up in the deployed service.
    I'm asking for help from our devops guy and a service developer but no response yet.
    I think I'll continue with WR validation in the mean time. Would love to finish my coding so we
    can review it.
    -------------------------------
    devops responded and showed me how to reploy from rancher. That did the trick.
    I can work on WR validation now until 1:1.
</p>
<p>

</p>
================================================================================================
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
    Need to refine the morning routine. I think I need to wake up and meditate for 10 minutes.
    Then I need to write in my journal for 10 minutes. Then I need to read for 10 minutes.
    Then I need to shower and get ready for work. I think this is a good routine to start the day.
    ---- I didnt write the full sentence. after routine it completed itself but I like it...
    Like Wake up at 5am start meditating by 5:05am to 5:15am. Write in journal from 5:15am to 5:25am. Read
    from 5:25am to 5:35am. Shower and get ready for work from 5:35am to 6am. This is a good routine.
    Anyways what I wanted to mention is I arrived at the parking spot ata 8:20am. Need to time how long it takes
    from car to desk. I've been trying to figure out which route is better from hayden or n scottsdale.
    I think they are similar enough that it doesnt matter. But hayden turn to parking spot today was 15m04s.
    Should also time way home from car to garage. All of this doesnt matter as much as waking up and getting the
    routine on point. Tomorrow need to be at desk at 6:30am. Based on today's routine that would mean a wake up
    of 3am... so that's why we need to change routine. 3 am is too early and sleep is important.
    UNRELATED- I was thinking about writing neural processes for common thought patterns or habits.
    Maybe one day we will sell packages to people for things like building the habit of gaining muscle or getting
    stronger... this sounds crazy but very possible. Someone has to write it, right?
    Prompt- Would you like to activate get out of bed when you planned to habit for $2.99? Or one time fee of $15.
    Like you subscribe to a habit until you build it.
    I want to build this.
    Build the successful man app.
    Why dont we start with building it in the phone with intention to cross over when its available?
    Do I want this?

    Started fixing bug reported by L, but is this best way to spend time?
    I wonder if I should let the bugs hit the queue finish what I was doing
    and then come back to the bugs? Although fixing some of these bugs
    would directly help some validations in current story...

    yeah im caught up in it but its okay.
    Brain is sort of doing what it wants. I need to add meditation in morning
    and before bed to reel it in. Structure is good.
    -------------------------------
    Have to say working on bugs simultneously while working on story is tough.
    It's tough to switch the code from one to the other, but more so for the brain
    to fully switch and focus from fixing PDR related validations to working
    on WR. I think it's one or the other for a block o time. Let's do 
    30 minutes of good WR validation work right now.

    A bit tired. Recovering from O not sleeping well on sunday night and last night wasnt great, but back

    I will finish WR validation now.

    finished standup. now let's work.
    Will update as we go.

    Good morning. I noticed yesterday that copilot is suggesting diary entries for me. That's funny.
    I don't need my thoughts automated, but it is interesting. Maybe I'm even more predictable than I can
    imagine. I'll journal IRL real quick and then dive in and then stand up begins. Be logical and focus.
    Today we use discipline. Keep phone down after 9am.
    -------------------------------
    had a sprint demo that was nice and quick. quick meetings are better.
    Have some team ideas that are popping up but dont wantt to rock the boat too much.
    What if we automate scheduled endpoint collection runs for start of work day in each env for the 
    following purposes-
        -to ensure that the endpoints are running and healthy.
        -to identify where issues are before you begin developing or testing in an environment
        -to identify exactly or generally what the issue is based on postman tests
        -to have clean valid requests available for each endpoint for everyone to use as template
        -manual run after every deploy as a confirmation deploy did not introduce any issues
    -------------------------------
    what could tests in endpoint runs identify?
        -correct status response
        -retrieving correct response body for get or save requests
    -------------------------------
    can version of testing review be useful or should we can it?
    also why didnt we have this conversation as a team?
    reviewing what will be tested after we worked on the endpoint is not useful is my gut instinct.
    just raise the bugs as you see them.
    what is the goal of our tasks? my opinion is the goal is to deliver a feature that is working.
    how to deliver a feature that is working as quickly as possible?
    how to identify all the questions as a TEAM before dev or QA start?
    why are we still competing to identify bugs?
    wouldnt it be worthwhile to have a list of questions that we all agree on before we start?

    Took a walk and today is day 1 for sprint 4. 13 days remaining. We will finish all tasks.
    It is hot outside, but it was a nice walk. I am timing myself to go in one direction for 13 minutes
    and then to return the same route back. I didnt manage to do this successfully today, but tomorrow I will.
    I am completing WR validation and then will update confluence for this. Then I will look at get claims for 
    bundles and standalone products. Let's see what bugs come back for PDR and Key validation stories.
    -------------------------------
    Watching a training video for Java Streams API Developer Guide on udemy.. idk if this is the best use of my time.

    My mind isnt so sharp. Is it sleep or food or what.
    Ate rice with stew and valentina this morning.
    drank the protein shake as well.
    Need to fix this.
    But focusing well.
    -------------------------------
    Also drank a hot chocolate which I know doesnt help but is yummy.
    I just want to get my processes down.. like we repeat the same stuff over and over
    so to struggle on same things doesnt make sense. Figure out how to debug a bug.
    How to strategize a stories tasks and how to ask the most necessary questions so
    that there is little doubt in the mind to move forwards TOWARDS a solution.

    Back from walk. Locking in now.
    NEED:
    -Update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    -Update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation.
    --------------------------------------------------------
    almost done with confluence for both and seeing fixes for feature branches that i'm making.

    this is good focus.
    done with MCL or key replacement validaiton for confluence.

    NEED:
    -Update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    -------------------------------
    I'm trying to follow exactly where in the code we pass the causeOfFailure but there is so
    much to look through. I think its somewhere in ClaimClientServiceImpl but idk.
    I'll start analyzing for WR and assume this is good for now.. Or can do some training instead.
    Yeah training sounds better.
</p>
<p>

</p>
================================================================================================
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
    A new day. New focus. New to do list. Some of the same tasks. Let's prioritize and complete everything.
    Switched from signed in as work github to personal. Hopefully ok.
    Think I knew this before but had to change the user.name and user.email in the terminal through git config --global user.email
    git config --global user.name so that commits come from personal account.
    Goals for today- update confluence 100% for validation for PDR and Key Replacement. Commit to feature branch for each 100%.
    Begin with WR validation. Better define what "Begin" means in a goal setting perspective.
    Other than goals I want to learn Java deeply. But not just Java more important for me is concepts that cross language boundaries.
    I want to begin O1v app or 01v or 0v1... hmmmm. Any ways get it off the ground. Concept. proof of concept what does that look like.
    Landing page. social area. social playground. connects into important stuff. security is everything. needs to be safe. identity.
    proof of identity for every login without it being a hassle. how to prove you are the correct person. because if this isnt 100%.
    then idea is bad. wallets plug in safely and securely. it is a hot wallet. and cold wallet layers. interact with others.
    monetize in one place. be your own everything. this is your pop up shop. this is your bank. this is your front facing image.
    this is where you show who you are and what you have to offer. and where money goes and is safe. and where it grows. and where
    you define risk and lend in various products. marketplace for others to build and share. decentralized opportunity.
    /endrant
</p>
<p>
    More important is to work through priorities so will copy and paste frequently until they
    are all done.-
    Commit to feature branch for PDR 100%.
    Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation. 
    Begin WR validation. Better define what "Begin" means in a goal setting perspective.

    Instead of begin let's define better now. how about analyze WR validation and make a list of 
    validations that exist NOW and validations that need to be added.
    That's better.

    Commit to feature branch for PDR 100%.
    Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation. 
    make a list of WR validations that exist NOW.
    make a list of WR validations that need to be added.

    Also I committed to feature branch for PDR already so going to remove that one and see if 
    after review we need to re-add it.

    Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation. 
    make a list of WR validations that exist NOW.
    make a list of WR validations that need to be added.

</p>
<p>
    Confirmed PDR feature branch looks good and ready for review. on to next task. Key Replacement.
    NEED:
    -Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    -update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    -update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation.

    NICE TO HAVE:
    -make a list of WR validations that exist NOW.
    -make a list of WR validations that need to be added.

    List is looking good. 3 things. 3 hours and one minute is enough time.
    -------------------------------

    NEED:
    -Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    -Update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    -Update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation.

    NICE TO HAVE:
    -Make a list of WR validations that exist NOW.
    -Make a list of WR validations that need to be added.
    --------------------------------------------------------

    moving off of branch feature-ECP-49 to feature-ECP-62.
    Leaving the NICE TO HAVE above and only continuing with the need. we know where it is
    if we have time for this.

    NEED:
    -Commit to feature branch for Key Replacement 100%.
    -Update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    -Update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation.
</p>
<p>
    OKAY so PDR and KEY code look good for pushing to feature branches.
    Also made sure feature-ancillary branch was merged into each before pushing.
    Also made sure configRepo branches look good and have latest updates to dev03-v2.

    now I am making changes to dev03-v2-ECP-62 before I confirm that is good with not-required
    fields.
    then i can focus entirely on confluence updates and then done that stuff. maybe start WR.
    --------------------------------------------------------

    NEED:
    -Update confluence 100% for PDR validation.
    -Update confluence 100% for Key Replacement validation.

    down to final 2 tasks.. will continue after this 25 minute walk.

    Got in the office early. Runnning stand up in a few and then will begin the day and update here.

</p>
<p>
    Tried to diagnose what was going on with a service error that QA was getting when trying to save draft from
    UI and then from sending request in service for cp port. Burned a lot of time trying to figure this out.
    I think going forward I need to document the process for trying to identify what is happening.
    In the sameway that CW1 looks at a problem and goes from one starting point and then branches towards
    a solution rather than pepper spraying and seeing all the possible problems or trying to see it from
    my perspective. Like a system for idenifying where the best starting point is. Starting from that starting point
    and going layer by layer which uncovers what is actually happening. If I was to write a rough draft of what this
    looks like it would be. Okay problem with saving a draft. Error is 500. Find in logs where error is popping up.
    It appears at read only fields where a null pointer is happening for partyId. Why is partyId null for this request?
    For non ancillary product we should not be checking for partyId? and this is where we are now.
