    Tried to diagnose what was going on with a service error that QA was getting when trying to save draft from
    UI and then from sending request in service for cp port. Burned a lot of time trying to figure this out.
    I think going forward I need to document the process for trying to identify what is happening.
    In the sameway that CW1 looks at a problem and goes from one starting point and then branches towards
    a solution rather than pepper spraying and seeing all the possible problems or trying to see it from
    my perspective. Like a system for idenifying where the best starting point is. Starting from that starting point
    and going layer by layer which uncovers what is actually happening. If I was to write a rough draft of what this
    looks like it would be. Okay problem with saving a draft. Error is 500. Find in logs where error is popping up.
    It appears at read only fields where a null pointer is happening for partyId. Why is partyId null for this request?
    For non ancillary product we should not be checking for partyId? and this is where we are now.
